# Drone Route Planning

### Problem Statement
---
 Planning a route (for **Shortest Time to cover Area**) and schedule of Drones for **Mapping** a given area.

 The **input** provided will be:
1) Map of area to be covered. (**Shapefile**) 
2) **Number** of drones. 
3) **Source** and **Sink** Locations 
4) Depreciation **Rate** (% per unit)
5) Location of automatic **Charging station**.

**Output** will be:
1) **Minimum** number of Drones required to map the area.
2) **All Unique Routes** taken by each drone.
3) Remaining **Battery** of each Drone after completing its journey.
4) A **Google Map** plotted with all **Nodes** and **Charging stations** and **edges** connecting them.
5) **All Unique Routes plotted on another Google Map as the final output with a different colour for each traversed route.**
